## Introduction 

This repository is related to the Capstone Assignment - AAA Northeast Member Analysis as part of the [**Postgraduate Diploma in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (PGDMLAI)**](https://emeritus.org/online-diploma-programs/postgraduate-diploma-in-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence/) program offered by the [Emeritus Institue](https://emeritus.org/) along with the [Columbia University - Engineering Executive Education](https://cvn.columbia.edu/content/columbia-engineering-executive-education-0).

## The Project

AAA Northeast is one of the regional clubs comprising the American Automobile Association.  AAA Northeast covers Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and portions of New York and New Jersey.  The American Automobile Association has 58 million members in the US and Canada.  They offer services such as roadside assistance, maps, and various discounts as part of their services.  Roadside assistance is a costly benefit, particularly towing.  Members who frequently use roadside assistance are less desirable.

AAA also offers other paid services at highly competitive prices.  They also offer insurance, travel, and banking/loan products.  AAA would like to increase the penetration of these services.

### Objectives

Provide a market segmentation of AAA members (or member households) that allows AAA Northeast to better serve its members.  They would use this analysis to:

    1. Better anticipate the needs of members
   
    2. Customize communications and offering to  various segments
   
    3. Expend more effort driving acquisition and renewal of desirable members

### Deliverables

    1. A slide deck describing your findings and the methodology that you used.
    
    2. The given repository with the source code
